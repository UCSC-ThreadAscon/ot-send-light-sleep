/**
 * The smallessst value of lambda used in the experiments by
 * Betlzer et al. was 0.75. However, I noticed that 0.75 generated
 * very short delays that were usually less than 1 second.
 *
 * Turning the lambda way do to 0.1 allows the wait time to be in the magnitude
 * of multiple seconds. This allows me to have the long delays seen in smart-home
 * network traffics, while also giving me a statistically significant number of
 * packets sent within a 2 hour period.
